How to switch between old(PCI) and new(PCIe) drivers?

Suppose you already correctly installed Plx and Pixie driver and libs. Now, to
switch from PCI to PCIe driver, just do the following with the code:
    1, in pixie16_ctl.h, change #include "pixie16app_export.h" to #include "pixie16/pixie16.h" and add #include "pixie16app_defs.h"  
    2, add -I/usr/local/xia/PixieSDK/include  flag in compiling the frontend in the makefile
    3, in makefile, change libs from "-lPixie16App -lPixie16Sys -lPlxApi" to "-lPixie16Api -lPlxApi"

If you want to change from PCIe to PCI, just reverse the above procedure.
