We used macros (#define) to determin the following different run modes:

1, #define DAQ_XIA
use this macro if XIA system is going to be used.
NOTE: USE_SLOW_MODE cannot be used in this case (see below)

2, #define USE_SLOW_MODE
use this macro if slow mode is going to be used (reset the infinite busy logic
when all data read out, i.e. event-by-event read out).
NOTE: cannot be used together with DAQ_XIA macro.

3, #define USE_DIRECT_SAVE
use this macro if a copy of data should be saved directly to files before
sending to event builder. 
NOTE: this feature reduces the performance, use it only for debugging purposes.
