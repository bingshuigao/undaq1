Initial version, let's get started!
This commit is mostly about the conceptual documentation. However, I found that
there are too much details in the documentation, it's not like a 'conceptual'
design document, it's more like a reference. So I will most probably delete
most of the staff in the next commit. If somehow the old docs are still wanted,
please checkout this commit.
