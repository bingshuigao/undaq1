Initial version, let's get started!
This commit is mostly about the conceptual documentation. However, I found that
there are too much details in the documentation, it's not like a 'conceptual'
design document, it's more like a reference. So I will most probably delete
most of the staff in the next commit. If somehow the old docs are still wanted,
please checkout this commit.


In this version, the classes for madc32, v830, v2718, v1190 are created (some
functions are left unimplemented yet). The base class vme_ctl and module are
also created. The class modules, which makes the read out of many modules of
the same type easier, is also created. All other vme modules should derive from
the base class module.
